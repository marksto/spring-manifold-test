# Testing the Spring and Manifold integration

A project for testing the consistency of [Spring](https://spring.io/) and 
[Manifold](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold) integration.

The [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) 
getting started project was used as a basis. Nonetheless, it may be expanded to 
cover any non-MVC-based project if required.
